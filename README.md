## Getting Started 

### On Rubin Science Platform

Make sure that you have access to the Rubin Science Platform and follow the instructions at [lsdb.io/dp1](https://lsdb.io/dp1). Note that LSDB data is still in soft launch phase, so you have to install `lsdb` package - e.g., by opening a notebook and running the following command (and restarting the kernel after it):

```
%pip install lsdb
```

After that you should be able to access:
```
lsdb.open_catalog('/rubin/lsdb_data/object_collection')
lsdb.open_catalog('/rubin/lsdb_data/dia_object_collection')
lsdb.open_catalog('/rubin/lsdb_data/object_photoz')
```

If you want to keep your enviroment clean, at the end of the workshop, uninstall `LSDB` and any other packages you may have installed with appropriate commands like
```
%pip uninstall lsdb
```

### Local installation
You can follow along with this demo by creating your own local environment.
If installing in your own hardware, create a virtual environment and install the relevant packages:

```
conda create --name lsdb_env python=3.12
conda activate lsdb_env
pip install lsdb
```

Note that you will have to change the paths to the data to point to local copy of Rubin Data Preview 1 data. 

## Notebooks

### [Notebook 1](Notebook_1.ipynb)

In this notebook we will learn how to:

- Import DASK client
- Load object and source catalogs (lazily)
- Show HATS partitioning with ZTF objects and source
- Perform crossmatching with existing `LSDB` catalogs
- Save the results of a science workflow to disk

### [Notebook 2](Notebook_2.ipynb)

In this notebook we will learn how to:

- What nested pandas is
- Do basic operations on timeseries

### [Notebook 3](Notebook_3.ipynb)

In this notebook we will learn how to:

- How to access photo-z catalog derived from Rubinâ€™s Data Preview 1 with LSDB 

### [Notebook 4](Notebook_4.ipynb)

In this notebook we will learn how to:

- Crossmatch custom list of positions
- How to access Object and diaObject data
- Show lightcurves for both Objects and diaObjects

### [Notebook 5](Notebook_5.ipynb)

In this notebook we provide several AGN-related problems:

- Crossmatch SDSS AGNs with Rubin DP1 photo-z catalog
- Crossmatch large catalog of AGN with Rubin DP1 data
- Run scientific analysis on lightcurves from Rubin DP1
